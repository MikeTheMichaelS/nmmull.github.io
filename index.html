<h1>This is the website of <i>Nathan Mull</i>.</h1>

<p>
Test. I am a fourth-year graduate student in the computer science department at the University of Chicago.
I am primarily interested in topics at the intersection of logic and computer science.
I spent some time researching the relationship between proof complexity and SAT-solvers.
More recently, I have been thinking about categorical logic and type theory.
