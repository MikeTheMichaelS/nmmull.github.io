My name is <i>NATHAN MULL</i>.
<br/>
I'm a graduate student.
<br/>
This is my website.
</h1>

<p>
I'm a PhD student in the UChicago CS department.
I'm interested in logic and computing.
I spent some time thinking about proof complexity and SAT-solvers, but more recently I've been thinking about categorical logic and type theory.
