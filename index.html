This is my website.

<p>
I'm a PhD student in the UChicago CS department.
I'm interested in logic and computing.
I spent some time thinking about proof complexity and SAT-solvers, but more recently I've been thinking about categorical logic and type theory.

<p>
I'm currently a TA for <i>CMSC 22400/32400: Programming Proofs</i></a> (Winter 2021).
