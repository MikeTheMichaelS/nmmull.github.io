My name is <i>NATHAN MULL</i>.

I'm a graduate student.

This is my website.

<p>
I'm a PhD student in the UChicago CS department.
I'm interested in logic and computing.
I spent some time thinking about proof complexity and SAT-solvers, but more recently I've been thinking about categorical logic and type theory.

<p>
I'm currently a TA for <a href="http://cmsc-16100.cs.uchicago.edu/2020-autumn/"><i>CMSC 16100: Honors Introduction to Programming</i></a> (Autumn 2020).
