<h1>
My name is <i>NATHAN MULL</i>.
I am a graduate student.
This is my website.
</h1>

<p>
I am a PhD student in the computer science department at the University of Chicago.
I am primarily interested in topics at the intersection of logic and computer science.
I spent some time researching the relationship between proof complexity and SAT-solvers.
More recently, I have been thinking about categorical logic and type theory.
