name is <em>NATHAN MULL</em>.<br>I'm a graduate student.<br>This is my
website.</h1>
<p>I'm a PhD student in the UChicago CS department. I'm interested in
logic and computing. I've spent some time thinking about proof
complexity and SAT-solvers, but more recently I've been thinking about
pure type systems and normalization.</p>

<p>(10/19/22) I gave an <strong>informal talk on Girard's
paradox</strong> for the <a
href="https://orecchia.net/event/theory-lunch/">UChicago Theory
Lunch</a>. I primarily wanted to emphasize why Martin-L&#xF6;f might have
include the axiom 'Type is a Type' in his type theory despite being
fully aware of classical set-theoretic paradoxes. [<a

<p>I've had the pleasure of teaching <strong>CMSC 10500: Fundamentals of
Computer Programming in Swift</strong> for several years now. In the
last few goes, I was able to compile my notes into a GitBook. The
material is loosely based on that of <a
href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html">SICP</a>
and <a href="http://www.composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>,
two invaluable introductory programming resources. [<a

<p>There are several <strong>proofs of false written in Idris</strong>
floating around on the internet, but this one is interesting to me
because it's not immediately clear what the problem is. The proof is in
essence the one of Girard's paradox. I believe the issue stems from the
way that universe levels are determined. [<a

<p>I'm pretty sure it's impossible to find a copy of <strong>Turing's
original proof that STLC is weakly normalizing</strong> (as published by
R.O. Gandy), so I decided to type up a version myself to make available
here. [<a href="pdfs/turing.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
