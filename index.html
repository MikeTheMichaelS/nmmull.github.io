    <p>
      I'm a PhD student in the
      <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu">UChicago CS department</a>.
      I'm generally interested in logic and computing.
      I've spent some time thinking about
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_complexity#SAT_solvers">proof complexity and SAT-solvers</a>,
      but more recently I've been thinking about
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_type_system">pure type systems and normalization</a>.

      (10/19/22)
      I gave an <strong>informal talk on Girard's paradox</strong> for the
      <a href="https://orecchia.net/event/theory-lunch/">UChicago Theory Lunch</a>.
      I primarily wanted to emphasize why Martin-L&#xF6;f might have include the axiom 'Type is a Type' in his type theory despite being fully aware of classical set-theoretic paradoxes.

    <p>
      I've had the pleasure of teaching <strong>CMSC 10500: Fundamentals of Computer Programming in Swift</strong> for several years now.
      In the last few goes, I was able to compile my notes into a GitBook.
      The material is loosely based on that of
      <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html">SICP</a>
      and
      <a href="http://www.composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>,
      two invaluable introductory programming resources.

    <p>
      There are several <strong>proofs of false written in Idris</strong> floating around on the internet.
      This one is an implementation of Girard's paradox which takes advantage of what seems to be a bug in the way universe levels are determined.

    <p>
      I'm pretty sure it's impossible to find a copy of
      <strong>Turing's original proof that STLC is weakly normalizing</strong>
      (as published by R.O. Gandy), so I decided to type up a version myself to make available here.
