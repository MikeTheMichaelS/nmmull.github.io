<h1>
This is my poetry.
</h1>

<h3>
loss
</h3>

<p>
now you are
<br>
gone
<br>
and the ribbon
<br>
you fluttered
<br>
through spacetime
<br>
will fray
</p>

<p>
and I pray
<br>
that some strand
<br>
accounts for
<br>
your being
</p>

<p>
that you may
<br>
revisit your
<br>
favorite folds
</p>

<p>
(for grandma)
</p>

<hr>

<h3>
time
</h3>

<p>
idle more
<br>
if you can
</p>

<p>
melt your
<br>
glass shard
<br>
thoughts
<br>
and make fear
<br>
not gone
<br>
but empty
</p>

<p>
until the hums
<br>
and sizzles
<br>
of your gut
<br>
heart
<br>
toes
<br>
etcetera
</p>

<p>
wake you to their
<br>
vague organic
<br>
doings
</p>

<h3>
winter
</h3>

<p>
walking
<br>
opposite me
<br>
through the
<br>
quadrangle
<br>
starring at
<br>
the tip-tops
<br>
of trees
<br>
leafless as
<br>
they are in
<br>
december
</p>

with a gentle
<br>
expression
<br>
not a smile
<br>
better maybe
<br>
but what
<br>
does it matter
</p>

<p>
the sun
<br>
showed pink
<br>
in her
<br>
cheeks
</p>

<hr>

<h3>
spring
</h3>

<p>
rabbits in
<br>
the yard 
<br>
again
<br>
not the same
<br>
as last year
<br>
i'd imagine
</p>

<p>
though
<br>
i suppose
<br>
i have never known
<br>
the movements
<br>
and patterns
<br>
of those creatures
</p>
