<h1>Course Policies</h1>
<p>There are a number of university and course specific policies you should be aware of. Read them carefully. Also keep in mind that, though I am required by the university to use specific language in some cases, I stand behind these policies sincerely and seriously, and I hope you feel comfortable reaching out to me about any one of them if you need to.</p>
<h2 id="disability-statement">Disability Statement</h2>
<p>If you have any kind of disability, please talk to me immediately. I am more than happy to provide any kind of accommodation that will help you succeed in this class.</p>
<p>If you require any accommodations for this course, as soon as possible please provide us with a copy of your Accommodation Determination Letter (provided to you by the Student Disability Services office) so that you may discuss with us how your accommodations may be implemented in this course.</p>
<p>The University of Chicago is committed to ensuring the full participation of all students in its programs. If you have a documented disability and, as a result, need a reasonable accommodation to participate in class, complete course requirements, or benefit from the University's programs or services, you are encouraged to contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible. To receive reasonable accommodation, you must be appropriately registered with Student Disability Services.</p>
<p>Please contact the office at 773-702-6000 or email: disabilities@uchicago.edu or visit the website at [<a href="disabilities.uchicago.edu">disabilities.uchicago.edu</a>].</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Please read the [<a href="https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/academic-policies/academic-honesty-plagiarism/">student manual</a>] and [<a href="https://provost.uchicago.edu/handbook/clause/academic-honesty-and-plagiarism">office of the provost handbook for academics</a>] on academic honesty and plagiarism. This is taken very seriously at the University of Chicago, and I take it very seriously in the courses I teach and support.</p>
<p>I encourage students to work in groups, I think it is a useful way to learn, but it is important that you do your own work and <em>never</em> let anyone use your work. You should cite both resources used and the discussions you had with other students. In any programming assignments, they should appear as comments at the top of the file:</p>
<pre><code>// I discussed problem 1 and 2 with program with Leah.
// She helped me understand X and Y aspects of the problem.</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>// I saw this stack overflow post:
// (url)
// which informed my solution.</code></pre>
<p>and even</p>
<pre><code>// I helped Zihan with problem 4.
// I told them to try using X.</code></pre>
<p>Of course, this is all tricky. When in doubt, err on the side of longer citations, more information. Also be aware that <em>all parties are culpable</em> when it comes to academic misconduct. Those who share their work with others (this includes sending files <em>and</em> screensharing) receive the same attention as those who use that work. Please email me immediately if you are unsure about a particular situation.</p>
<h2 id="sexual-misconduct">Sexual Misconduct</h2>
<p>Please read the [<a href="https://equalopportunityprograms.uchicago.edu/title-ix-and-university-policy/">office of the provost title IX and university policy</a>] and review the entire site for information about talking to someone confidentially about experiences of sexual misconduct, filing a report, and any other relevant information. Above all, you should feel safe, and able to be productive. If this is not the case, please reach out to me or someone else immediately.</p>
<p>The university is legally obligated to investigate reports of sexual misconduct, and therefore it cannot guarantee the confidentiality of a report, but it will consider a request for confidentiality and respect it to the extent possible. I am also required to report incidents of sexual misconduct and cannot guarantee confidentiality. I must provide our Title IX coordinator with relevant details such as the names of those involved in the incident.</p>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>Diversity is a necessary part of a successful academic environment. My aim is to present materials in a way that respects diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, generational status, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, immigration status, and otherwise. If I fail to do this, please make me aware. Any suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="recording-and-zoom">Recording and Zoom</h2>
<p>Unless it is updated, we will adhere to the [<a href="https://teachingremotely.uchicago.edu/spring-quarter-2020-recording-policy/">Spring 2020 Recording Policy</a>].</p>
<p>We will be using Zoom in this course. Please enter the Zoom meetings muted if possible (unfortunately, this is not possible if you're calling in), and unmute to speak. Zoom also has chat capabilities if you prefer this. Though it is nice to see you as feedback for myself, you are not required to show your video, and should only show your video if you are comfortable doing so.</p>
