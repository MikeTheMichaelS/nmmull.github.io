<h1>Remote Teaching and Learning</h1>
<p>Many of you may have experienced your first online course this spring and, consequently, many instructors taught their first online courses. Everyone is experimenting, trying to figure out what works. This course will be no different.</p>
<h2 id="personal-philosophy">Personal Philosophy</h2>
<p>I think it is easy for instructors in the online setting to become glorified content-producers. I have two issues with this. First: there is already so much good content, especially for introductory programming courses. Second: teaching, to me, is about interaction. The challenge for me then has been to determine what I can offer as an alternative to in-person learning, as opposed an imitation of it.</p>
<p>I will be producing material, but I will try to keep it simple, and I will refer to other good material when it is available. I will likely not be producing videos. This is, in part, because my living situation does not adequately allow for this. The one form of content that I will put a fair amount of effort into is assignments. My view is that an online course should be something like a well-organized form of extrinsic motivation. This course has <em>a lot</em> of work, but this is how to get better at programming: do it <em>a lot</em>.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>
<p>We will be using the <em>flipped</em> course structure. You will be doing a fair amount of offline reading. Lectures will be a chance to meet and discuss the material.</p>
<p>For every lecture, there are (usually) two associated topics. This accounts for the fact that we are doing ten weeks of work in five weeks. You will be expected to read the associated material <em>before</em> lecture. As you work through the material you should write down your questions, what confused you. You can either ask these questions on Piazza or save them for when we meet during our scheduled lecture time.</p>
<p>Our lectures will be treated more like conference calls. I will begin each lecture with a short preamble on the material that you should have read. This will be followed by a short Q&amp;A session. We will then work through a couple examples, and you will occasionally have the opportunity to work through a couple examples yourself, either in Zoom breakout rooms or individually. The lectures will be recorded so you can refer back to them.</p>
<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>
<p>Labs will be an opportunity for you to write code and test some of the ideas we cover. During the allotted lab time, I will hold a Zoom meeting as with the lectures. At the beginning, I will discuss briefly the ideas in the lab and then you will be free to work. I will stay on the call for the full two hours to answer questions, but you are welcome leave the call and come back at any time, start new calls with other class members, or just stay on as well.</p>
<h2 id="individual-meetings">Individual Meetings</h2>
<p>I would like to schedule weekly 10-30 minute individual meetings with everyone. This is probably the most "experimental" part of the course, and is only possible because the group is small. My hope is that these will make up for lack of in-person meetings (and the lack of video lectures, for those of your who prefer that medium). The purpose of these meetings will be for me to check-in, go over your submissions, discuss what might be confusing or difficult for you, and generally get acquainted. You can opt out of these meetings, but I think they will be one of the more valuable parts of this course.</p>
