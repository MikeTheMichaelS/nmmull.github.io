<h1>Unlimited Register Machines: A Toy Model</h1>
<p>We begin our somewhat unconventional journey into programming with an examination of <em>unlimited register machines (URMs)</em>. These mathematical objects are used by N.J. Cutland in his book <em>Computability</em> as a model of computation for proving theorems in computability theory, a subfield of logic. We'll be using the simple programming language accompanying URMs as a testing ground for basic concepts. Because it's so simple, we'll be able explore pretty much all of it in one sitting. From this exercise, I hope to emphasize two points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many basic principles of programming are language independent. In particular, programming requires a particular mode of thinking that is transferable to other languages and even to non-programming contexts.</li>
<li>If we want to fully understand a programming language, we need a working <em>model of execution</em>, i.e., a high-level but formal abstraction for how the program behaves. This way, no matter how you run your code, be it on a computer from the 80s or a futuristic MacBook running OS20, or simply in your head, the observable behavior of your code is fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-definition">The Definition</h2>
<p>A URM is comprised of a collection of registers, which may be thought of as boxes or containers, that can hold any natural number (0, 1, 2, and so on). These registers are usually visualized as being arranged in a single row from left to right, so that we may refer to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th register as the one in the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th position. A note: the convention in computer science is to <em>zero index</em> sequences, which is to say that the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>th element of a sequence refers to the element at the front, the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>st element refers to the element after that, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/urm.png" style="zoom:25%;" /></p>
<p>Despite their simplicity, URMs are not unreasonable models of real computers, which do store numeric values in fixed locations of their hardware. The model diverges from reality in how these locations are arranged, how they are accessed, and the range of values they can store.</p>
<h2 id="urm-programs">URM Programs</h2>
<p>The basic building blocks of a URM program are <em>instructions</em>, of which there are only four:</p>
<ul>
<li>the increment instruction, written <code>S(i)</code>,</li>
<li>the zero instruction, written <code>Z(i)</code>,</li>
<li>the transfer instruction, written <code>T(i)</code>, and</li>
<li>the jump instruction, written <code>J(i, j, k)</code>,</li>
</ul>
<p>where <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> are arbitrary natural numbers. A <em>URM program</em> is a sequence of instructions. We'll write URM programs so that each instruction appears on its own line.</p>
<p>Though these instructions have suggestive names, a program is a syntactic object; it is just a collection of symbols. This is one of the beauties of programming; the wildly complex consequences of computer programs start with plain text files. A program is meaningless without a model of execution. In practice, a language has an <em>interpreter</em>, another program that executes programs in that language, i.e., that implements its model of execution. This might, at first, seems terribly circular (a program for running other programs, where does it end?) though it should feel less so in time.</p>
<h3 id="an-aside-interpreters-vs.-compilers">An Aside: Interpreters vs. Compilers</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, we will be using a Swift <em>compiler</em>,&#xA0;not an interpreter (through I sometimes find the distinction a bit artificial). Whereas an interpreter executes programs of another language, a compiler translates code from one language into code of other than can be run on the machine you are using. The distinction is inconsequential for this course, except that I will refer to the Swift compiler (not interpreter) in the material.</p>
<h2 id="interpreting-urm-programs">Interpreting URM Programs</h2>
<p>In the model of execution for URM programs, we maintain a URM <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and a natural number <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. The number <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> represents the index of the next instruction to be executed and is initially set to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. We can imagine <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> as an arrow that points at the next instruction (and I will draw it this way below). The initial state of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, before any instructions have been executed, is specified by a finite sequence of natural numbers called <em>inputs</em>. The <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th element in the sequence is put in the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th register of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, and all other registers store the number <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Given a program <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and a sequence of inputs, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is initialized according to the inputs and then <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are updated according to the following rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>th instruction is <code>S(i)</code>, the value of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th register of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is increased by one and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is increased by one.</li>
<li>If it is <code>Z(i)</code>, the value of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th register of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is set to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is increased by one.</li>
<li>If it is <code>T(i, j)</code> then the value of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th register of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is copied into the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th register of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is increased by one.</li>
<li>If it is <code>J(i, j, k)</code>, then <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is set to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> if the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th register and the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th register of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> contain the same value. Otherwise, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is increased by one.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules can be visualized as follows.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/succ-urm.png" style="zoom:33%;" /></p>
<hr />
<p><img src="../Images/zero-urm.png" style="zoom:33%;" /></p>
<hr />
<p><img src="../Images/transfer-urm.png" style="zoom:33%;" /></p>
<hr />
<p><img src="../Images/jump-urm.png" style="zoom:33%;" /></p>
<p>These rules are carried out as long as possible. When <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is greater than or equal to the number of instruction in <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, the program is said to <em>terminate</em> and its <em>output</em> is the value in the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>th register. It's possible that a program never terminates, like the program</p>
<pre><code>J(1, 1, 0)</code></pre>
<p>with a single jump instruction. In general, the jump instruction is the only one that allows you to move <em>backwards</em> in a program, so it gives power to the language but can also cause the most trouble.</p>
<p>And that's it, you've just learned a programming language in it's entirety, albeit a simple one. Though, from a theoretical perspective this language is just as powerful as Swift, it is so-called <em>Turing complete</em>. Imagine trying to write iOS applications in this language!</p>
<h2 id="syntax-and-semantics">Syntax and Semantics</h2>
<p>We've just described a simple programming language in two separate parts: its <em>syntax</em> and its <em>semantics</em>. Its syntax is the collection of guidelines for determining those arrangements of symbols, those plain text files, which constitute well-formed programs. Its semantics is the collection of rules for determining the meaning of those well-formed programs. The strict separation of syntax and semantics is crucial in the enterprise of programming, though the full scope of reasons why might not be fully appreciable at the moment. One reason of particular importance to us now is that it provides a possible justification for why programming is so interesting. It's obvious that syntactically equivalent programs, programs composed of identical arrangements of symbols, should be semantically equivalent, they should do the same thing. But there are so many syntactically distinct programs which are semantically equivalent; determining which one is the "right" one in a given context is the role of the programmer.</p>
<h2 id="some-examples">Some Examples</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to compute the sum of two natural numbers. That is, we want to write a program that, given inputs <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, terminates with output <span class="math inline">\(x + y\)</span>. One approach is to increment the value of the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>th register, which contains <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, as many times as the value in the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>st register, which contains <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We can do this by maintaining a <em>counter</em> in a third register which is incremented at the same rate as the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>th register. The program should then terminate if the counter register has the same value as the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>st register, which can be done using a jump instruction. Here is such a program, which we will refer to below as <code>BIN-ADD</code>.</p>
<pre><code>J(1, 2, 100)
S(0)
S(2)
J(0, 0, 0)</code></pre>
<p>A couple notes about this program:</p>
<ul>
<li>The third value in the line <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>, but the smallest number we could have used is <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. We can use any value that is larger than the length of the program so that the program terminates.</li>
<li>The last jump instruction compares the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>th register with itself. This is mechanism for moving around a program without performing any comparisons.</li>
<li>The value of the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>st and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>nd registers are not <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> when the program terminates. This is fine. Nothing in the semantics requires that the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>th register be the only one with a nontrivial value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an animation of an example computation with inputs <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/add-example.gif" style="width:750px" /></p>
<p>Simple enough, for a more complicated example, suppose we want to determine if a given number is odd. That is, we want to write program that, given a single input <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, outputs <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even. One approach would be to maintain a counter, starting at <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and then add <em>two</em> to the counter periodically, seeing if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is equal to the counter at any point. This would work if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is actually odd, but what if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even? This approach would, say, check if <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>...and so on forever. How can we fix this?</p>
<p>(I recommend taking a pause at this point and thinking about it before reading the next paragraph.)</p>
<p>One approach: we keep track of <em>two</em> counters, one starting at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and one starting at <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, add two to each of them periodically and check if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is equal to either. If at any point <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is equal to one of the counters, depending on which counter it is, we know if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even or odd.</p>
<p>The last sticking point: we need to do something different depending on which counter <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is equal to in the end. How do we do this? It'll take a bit of mental gymnastics with the jump operation. We can jump to different parts of the program depending on the different cases. In all, we get the following program.</p>
<pre><code>S(2)
J(0, 1, 8)
J(0, 2, 10)
S(1)
S(1)
S(2)
S(2)
J(0, 0, 1)
Z(0)
J(0, 0, 100)
Z(0)
S(0)</code></pre>
<p>The first line starts one of the counters at <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and then the input value is compared periodically to the two counters that are incremented by two each iteration. Once the input is equal to one of the counters the program jumps to either line 8 or 10, which represent to two possible output branches. Note, in particular, the jump instruction at line 9, that ensures that lines 10 and 11 are not run if the branch at line 8 is taken. Here is an animation of this process with input <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>

<p>You will have an opportunity to see more examples in the assignment for this module.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-section-subroutines">Bonus Section: Subroutines</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to compute the sum of <em>three</em> numbers. We can do this by computing the sum of the first and second number, and then computing the sum of the result and the third number. Let's call this program <code>TRI-ADD</code>.</p>
<pre><code>J(1, 3, 4)
S(0)
S(3)
J(0, 0, 0)
J(2, 4, 100)
S(0)
S(4)
J(0, 0, 4)</code></pre>
<p>We are performing a rough form of <em>program composition</em> here, where the output of one program is fed into another program. The first half and the second half of this program look similar because they both are, in essence, the same as <code>BIN-ADD</code>. This process can be generalized so that we can compose any programs and, more generally, use any program as a <em>subroutine</em> in another. First, let's rewrite <code>BIN-ADD</code> as a general template <code>BIN-ADD-SUBROUTINE</code>. Let <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>l</code> and <code>m</code> be arbitrary natural numbers.</p>
<pre><code>Z(k)
Z(k + 1)
Z(k + 2)
T(i, k)
T(j, k + 1)
J(k + 1, k + 2, l + 9)
S(k)
S(k + 2)
J(0, 0, l + 5)
T(k, m)</code></pre>
<p>This program (template) adds the values the <code>i</code>th and <code>j</code>th register, performing its work starting at register <code>k</code>, and transfers the result into register <code>m</code>. The variables <code>l</code> refers to the line number of the first instruction in the subroutine, as this code might appear anywhere in a more complex program. It has four phases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>clearing the work space,</li>
<li>transferring the input,</li>
<li>performing the procedure, and</li>
<li>transferring the output.</li>
</ol>
<p>When <code>i = 0</code>, <code>j = 1</code>, <code>k = 100</code>, <code>l = 0</code>, and <code>m = 0</code>, this program is semantically equivalent to <code>ADD-TWO</code>. More complicated, sure, but it is easier to imagine how we might include it in more complex programs. We can, for example, write the program for adding three numbers like so.</p>
<pre><code>Z(100)
Z(101)
Z(102)
T(0, 100)
T(1, 101)
J(101, 102, 9)
S(100)
S(102)
J(0, 0, 5)
T(100, 0)
Z(100)
Z(101)
Z(102)
T(0, 100)
T(2, 101)
J(101, 102, 19)
S(100)
S(102)
J(0, 0, 15)
T(100, 0)</code></pre>
<p>This program is certainly longer than its predecessor, it has some unnecessary instructions like the first three zero instructions. But it's constructed by creating two copies of <code>BIN-ADD-SUBROUTINE</code> and filling in the appropriate values. No need to keep track of a bunch of auxiliary counter registers ourselves. That said, this should be done with a bit of care; we don't want the subroutine to erase work done for other parts of the program.</p>
