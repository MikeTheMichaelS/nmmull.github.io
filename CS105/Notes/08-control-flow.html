<h1>Control Flow</h1>
<p>In our overview of Swift we saw the basics of conditional statements. Such statements are generally called <em>control flow</em> statements, and are arguably the most important part of an imperative language like Swift. One might even say that <em>programming is managing control flow</em>. In URMs, jump instructions manage control flow. Without the jump instruction, the class of functions that can be expressed with URM programs is severely limited. In Swift, we have a collection of more expressive control flow statements that read like conditional sentences in English. In this module we'll see control flow statements in more detail, and cover some common practices.</p>
<h2 id="the-if-statement">The <code>if</code> Statement</h2>
<p>The general form of an <code>if</code> statement is</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if &lt;condition&gt; {
  &lt;body&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code> is an expression of type <code>Bool</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is a block of code. In English, this reads "if <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>, then execute the code in <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, otherwise ignore it."</p>
<p>The absolute value function, for example, can be written</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>func absoluteValue(_ n: Int) -&gt; Int {
    if n &gt;= 0 {
        return n
    }
    return -n
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we explicitly use the fact that the function terminates once it reaches a <code>return</code> statement. The second <code>return</code> statement is only executed if <code>n &gt;= 0</code> is <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Simple enough, I think.</p>
<p>There are a couple convenient variations of the <code>if</code> statement that help with readability. The <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> statement allows you to also specify code to execute in the case that <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code> evaluates to <code>false</code>.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if &lt;condition&gt; {
    &lt;body1&gt;
} else {
    &lt;body2&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p>This is particularly useful if the conditional statement does not ultimately return something. The code</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if n &gt; 0 {
    n *= 2    // note the use of the compound assignment operator...
} else {
    n += 1
}</code></pre>
<p>does not behave the same as</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if n &gt; 0 {
    n *= 2
}
n += 1</code></pre>
<p>even though</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if n &gt; 0 {
    return 2 * n
} else {
    return n + 1
}</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if n &gt; 0 {
    return 2 * n
} else {
return n + 1</code></pre>
<p>behave the same (when they appear in the body of a function). We can also chain together if statements using the <code>else if</code> construction.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if &lt;condition1&gt; {
    &lt;body1&gt;
} else if &lt;condition2&gt; {
    &lt;body2&gt;
} else if &lt;condition3&gt; {
    &lt;body3&gt;
} </code></pre>
<p>This is really just shorthand (<em>syntactic sugar</em>, as it is called in computer science) for</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if &lt;condition1&gt; {
    &lt;body1&gt;
} else { if &lt;condition2&gt; {
    &lt;body2&gt;
} else { if &lt;condition3&gt; {
  &lt;body3&gt;
}}}</code></pre>
<p>which saves us from typing a long line of closing brackets. Both <code>else if</code> and <code>else</code> can be used together, as long as the <code>else</code> substatement appears last.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>func parityInWords(_ x: Int) -&gt; String {
    var parity: String = &quot;&quot;
    if x &gt; 0 {
        parity = &quot;positive&quot;
    } else if x &lt; 0 {
        parity = &quot;negative&quot;
    } else {
        parity = &quot;neither postive nor negative&quot;
    }
    return &quot;\(x) is \(parity).&quot;    // note the use of string interpolation...
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="nesting-if-statements">Nesting <code>if</code> Statements</h3>
<p>As you might expect, the body of an <code>if</code> statement can contain another <code>if</code> statement. However, this should be done judiciously. With logical operators in Swift, we can produce more logically complex conditions. In particular, we can use the conjunction to unnest some <code>if</code> statements. For example,</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if b1 {
    if b2 {
        &lt;body&gt;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>can be replaced with</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if b1 &amp;&amp; b2 {
    &lt;body&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p>Swift even allows us to use commas instead of conjunction:</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if b1, b2 {
    &lt;body&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p>And the comma is slightly more powerful than pure conjunction because it can be used in tandem with optional binding, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if let x = optionalInt, x &gt; 3 {
    &lt;body&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p>which reads in English as "if <code>optionalInt</code> has a value that is greater than three...". So, for example, we can write a function that gets all the keys from a dictionary that map to large values as follows.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>func keysWithLargeValues(greaterThan n: Int, from d: [String: Int]) -&gt; [String] {
    var output: [String] = []
    for key in d.keys {
        if let val = d[key], val &gt; n {
            output.append(key)
        }
    }
    return output
}</code></pre>
<p>The moral of the story: don't forget that you can create logically complex conditions!</p>
<h3 id="an-aside-returning-booleans">An Aside: Returning Booleans</h3>
<p>Another practice with new programmers that's not <em>wrong</em> but is in sort of bad style is returning <code>Bool</code>s based on conditions. It is not unusual to find code the looks like</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>if boolExp {
  return false
} else {
  return true
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the <code>if</code> statement is unnecessary. This code has the same behavior as</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>return !boolExp</code></pre>
<p>I see this often enough that I think it is worth bringing up! And if you find this in your code, don't be embarrassed! It happens to the best of us. Just remember to think of your code as a garden: once you've planted it you're not done, you also have to maintain it, clean it up, make it more efficient, etc.</p>
<h3 id="semi-advanced-topic-guard-statements">(Semi-)Advanced Topic: <code>guard</code> Statements</h3>
<p><code>guard</code> statements aren't complicated, they're just rarely covered because they don't add much beyond what is offered by <code>if</code> statements. But I think they are a good example of the kind of extra expressivity that is characteristic of Swift.</p>
<p>A <code>guard</code> statement is essentially an <code>if</code> statement but with <em>only</em> an <code>else</code> part. The general form is</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>guard &lt;expression&gt; else {
    &lt;body&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p>and it reads "if <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> does not hold (i.e., it evaluates to false), then run the code in <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. That is, we "guard" against the case that <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> holds by breaking out of the main logic of our program and jumping into a break-in-case-of-emergency block of code.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways we could use guard statements, but one is to provide more elegant exit strategies for code. Consider this example similar to one from a previous module.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>func sumOfInts(upTo n: Int) -&gt; Int {
    assert(n &gt;= 0)
    var counter = 1
    var total = 0
    while counter &lt;= n {
        total += counter
        counter += 1
    }
    return total
}</code></pre>
<p>In this function, we've included an assert statement as a way of crashing the program in the case that <code>sumOfInts</code> is called on a negative number. But as you've probably seen by now, when an assertion fails it produces a very ugly error message. In production code, we might want this to look a bit nicer, so we can replace the assertion with a guard.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>func sumOfInts(upTo n: Int) -&gt; Int {
    guard n &gt;= 0 else {
        print(&quot;Error: sumOfInts called on a negative number&quot;)
        exit(1)
    }
    var counter = 1
    var total = 0
    while counter &lt;= n {
        total += counter
        counter += 1
    }
    return total
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>print</code>&#xA0;expressions explains to the user what happened and <code>exit(_:)</code> is a special function that breaks out of a Swift program (the argument <code>1</code> indicates that the program failed, but this isn't important for us now).</p>
<h2 id="the-while-statement">The <code>while</code> Statement</h2>
<p>Then general form of a <code>while</code> statement (also called a <code>while</code> loop) is</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>while &lt;condition&gt; {
    &lt;body&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p>In English, it reads "while <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code> is <code>true</code> execute the code in <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Once <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code> is <code>false</code>, go to the next part of the program, after the closing bracket." If the condition is false to begin with, the code in the body is ignored. In most cases, the condition should have the possibility of changing within the body of the <code>while</code> statement. <code>while</code> statements are the simplest form of control flow and, as you will see in the assignment, are the only kind of control flow that's actually necessary.</p>
<p>The instances in which you get the most out of <code>while</code> loops is when you don't know how many times you're going to perform some action. As a high level example, if you're designing a game, you don't know beforehand how many times the player is going to want to restart after losing. So generally, code for games has what amounts to an overarching <code>while</code> loop to keep track of the game session.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>var stillWantsToPlay = true
var quitButtonClicked = false
...
while stillWantsToPlay {
    // CODE FOR GAME PLAY
    ...
    if quitButtonClicked {
        stillWantsToPlay = false
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>For a more concrete example, suppose we want to know the exponent of the largest power of two that divides some given number, we can repeatedly divide our number by two until it's odd, but we don't know beforehand how many times this will happen.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>func powerOfTwoDivisor(_ n: Int) -&gt; Int {
    var counter = 0
    var m = n
    while m % 2 == 0 {
        m /= 2
        counter += 1
    }
    return counter
}

assert(powerOfTwoDivisor(10) == 1)
assert(powerOfTwoDivisor(15) == 0)
assert(powerOfTwoDivisor(16) == 4)
assert(powerOfTwoDivisor(20) == 2)</code></pre>
<h3 id="semi-advanced-topic-repeat-while-statements">(Semi-)Advanced Topic: <code>repeat</code>-<code>while</code> statements</h3>
<p>Like with <code>guard</code> statements, <code>repeat</code>-<code>while</code> statements are not complicated, just often forgotten, even though they can greatly improve code readability. All a <code>repeat</code>-<code>while</code> statement is: a <code>while</code> statement where the condition is checked after the body of the statement instead of before. It has the general form</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>repeat {
  &lt;body&gt;
} while &lt;condition&gt;</code></pre>
<p>and has the consequence of running the body of the statement at least once in the beginning.</p>
<p>How might this be useful? Well, suppose you're writing your own REPL for some language. The REPL repeats a process an indefinite number of times, so it is a great application of a <code>while</code> loop, but the first step of prompting someone to type in a command is <em>always</em> performed. So we can instead use a <code>repeat</code>-<code>while</code> statement instead.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>var line: String? = nil
repeat {
    print(&quot;&gt; &quot;, terminator: &quot;&quot;)
    line = readLine()
    // CODE FOR REPL
    ...
} while line != nil &amp;&amp; line != &quot;:q&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We'll talk more about IO in our next lab, so don't worry too much about the details. The point is just that we know we have to prompt the user at least once at the start of running the code, hence, the <code>repeat</code>-<code>while</code> statement.</p>
<h2 id="the-for-in-range-statement">The <code>for-in-range</code> statement</h2>
<p><code>for-in-range</code> statements, also called <code>for</code> loops, are simple in their use but complicated in their details. We've already seen that we can iterate over arrays and dictionaries using <code>for</code> loops, and it might be reasonable to assume that's the extent of the <code>for</code> loop. But, in fact, we can apply the <code>for</code> loop to a great number of things, and we'll even be able to define our own things that can be used in <code>for</code> loops. Generally something that can be iterated over is called a <em>Sequence</em>. We'll see how things become sequences and what the <code>for</code> loop actually does with sequences near the end of the course.</p>
<p>One example of something that can be iterated over that's not an array or a dictionary is a <em>range</em> of <code>Ints</code>, provided by the <em>range operators</em> (<code>a...b</code>) and (<code>a..&lt;b</code>). The <em>inclusive range</em> <code>a...b</code> includes <code>b</code> where as the <em>exclusive range</em> <code>a..&lt;b</code> does not. It <em>must</em> be the case that <span class="math inline">\(a \leq b\)</span> for these operators to work, otherwise Swift will complain and the program will crash. Note that <code>a..&lt;a</code> is an empty range.</p>
<p>The general form of a <code>for-in-range</code> statement is</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>for &lt;indexName&gt; in &lt;sequence&gt; {
    &lt;body&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p>In English, it reads "execute the code in <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> for each value <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in <code>&lt;sequence&gt;</code>, with the constant <code>&lt;indexName&gt;</code> set to the value <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>."</p>
<p>With these ranges, we can get a more natural definition of the <code>sumOfInts</code> function above (ignoring the issues of assertions and guards for now).</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>func sumOfInts(upTo n: Int) -&gt; Int {
    var total = 0
    for i in 0...n {
        total += i
    }
    return total
}</code></pre>
