<h1>Introduction to Xcode and SwiftUI</h1>
<p>The video for this material is available on Canvas. In the video, I discuss Xcode and the basics of SwiftUI. Here are a couple of the main ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The user interface of an iOS application is made up of views, which are objects of types that conform to the <code>View</code> protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Conforming to the <code>View</code> protocol requires implementing a single computed property <code>body</code> of type <code>some View</code>, which is a special Swift way of saying "any type which is a view."</p></li>
<li><p>Building views in in Swift UI is an example of <em>declarative programming</em>. The main difference between this and what we have seen is that there is no notion of time. The views describe the state of the UI, independent of time, but dependent on some other structure (class actually, more on that later) that keeps track of the functionality of the code.</p></li>
<li><p>There are a number of basic views that we will use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Text(_:)</code>, a view containing the input text</li>
<li><code>Rectangle()</code>, a view in the shape of a rectangle</li>
<li><code>RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius:)</code>, a view in the shape of a rectangle with rounded edges.</li>
<li><code>Circle()</code>, a view in the shape of a circle</li>
<li><code>Spacer()</code>, a view with empty space</li>
</ul>
<p>Different views have different behaviors with respect to how they fill the space on the screen. <code>Text</code>&#xA0;views try to take as little space as possible, whereas <code>Rectangles()</code> try to take as much space as possible. We will discuss this a bit more when we talk about layouts.</p></li>
<li><p>Views can be combined using <em>container views</em>. You can create custom container views, but we will mostly be using some standard built in ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ZStack { ... }</code>, a view containing several views layers on top of each other</li>
<li><code>HStack { ... }</code>, a view containing several views side by side, from left to right</li>
<li><code>VStack { ... }</code>, a view containing several views arranged from top to bottom</li>
</ul>
<p>The views appearing in the brackets each appear on their own line. The brackets are an example of a [<a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#ID102"><em>trailing closure</em></a>], which we have not formally discussed but you should read about.</p></li>
<li><p>Views have methods for describing their features (note that we don't say they change their features, since this would imply a notion of time).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.foregroundColor(:_)</code> describes the color of a view. It takes a <code>Color</code>, for which there are static variables for standard colors like <code>.red</code> and <code>.blue</code>.</li>
<li><code>.font()</code> describes the font used within the view. It takes a <code>Font</code>, for which there are static variables for standard system fonts like <code>.largeTitle</code></li>
<li><code>.frame(...)</code> describes the size and shape of the view.</li>
<li><code>.onTapGesture { ... }</code> describes what should happen in the application if the view is pressed by the user.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
