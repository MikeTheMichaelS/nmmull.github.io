<h1>Mini Project 2: Tic Tac Toe</h1>
<p>For this project, you will be implementing the game tic tac toe. You have the choice of either building a command-line game or an iOS application. If you are unfamiliar with the game, please read the [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Tic Tac Toe Wikipedia page</a>].</p>
<h2 id="tictactoegame"><code>TicTacToeGame</code></h2>
<p>For either version of the project, you will start by completing a structure called <code>TicTacToeGame</code> which contains all the functionality necessary for gameplay.</p>
<p>You will need to read through the existing code and understand what it does. You then have to fill in the methods and properties labeled <code>TODO</code>. You are allowed to add more methods and properties. I recommend doing this using extensions.</p>
<p><em>Note.</em> We will allow the board to be a square grid of any size. For any size board, a player wins if they have occupied all the positions in any row, column or diagonal. There are other variations which you are welcome to implement instead!</p>
<h2 id="version-1-terminal-tic-tac-toe-with-a-computer-player">Version 1: Terminal Tic Tac Toe with a Computer Player</h2>
<p>For this version of the project, the code for running a <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 3\)</span> game in the command line has been provided. Your task will be to write a function which makes moves for the computer player. The function <code>makeComputerMove()</code> is included in an extension to the <code>TicTacToeGame</code> structure. To implement this function, you will be using a procedure called [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax</a>].</p>
<p>Minimax is a basic algorithm for building computer players for two player games. Variations and extensions of minimax are used for chess and go playing programs (like alphaGo). It is a recursive procedure that determines the best possible move for a given player based on the following principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the best possible move is the one which leads to the best outcome if the other player always makes their best move.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More formally, each tic tac toe game state (a tic tac toe board with some pieces on it, or more specifically, an instance of <code>TicTacToeGame</code>) is given a minimax score, <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimax score of a game state in which the X player has won is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>The minimax score of a game state in which the O player has won is <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>.</li>
<li>The minimax score of a draw is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</li>
<li>If the game is not over and it's the X player's turn, then the minimax score is the <strong>maximum</strong> of the minimax scores of all game states that result from the X making a move.</li>
<li>If the game is not over and it's the O player's turn, then the minimax score is the <strong>minimum</strong> of the minimax scores of all the game states that result from X making a move.</li>
</ul>
<p>The X player's best move is then the one that maximizes the minimax score of the resulting game state, and the O player's best move is the one that minimizes the minimax score of the resulting game state.</p>
<h3 id="your-task">Your Task</h3>
<p>You need to implement the function <code>makeComputerMove()</code> which should contain an implementation of the function <code>minimax(_:)</code>. You will know when you have succeeded if the computer player always draws or wins.</p>
<h3 id="extra-credit-opportunity-heuristic-value-function-for-depth-limited-minimax">Extra Credit Opportunity: Heuristic Value Function for Depth Limited Minimax</h3>
<p>Your minimax implementation will be too slow for even a <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> tic tac toe game. Usually, minimax includes a <em>heuristic value function</em>, which makes it faster at the cost of accuracy.</p>
<p>Often in games like chess or go, it is possible to look at a board and <em>guess</em> how likely it is that you will win. Of course, the further away either player is from winning, the harder it is to gauge whether or not you're going to win. A heuristic value function gives this intuition a numeric value, it analyzes the state of the game and returns a value <em>between</em> <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> which is a measure of how good the game state is for a player. Higher is better for the X player, with <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> meaning that the X player is sure to win or has already won.</p>
<p>There is no <em>correct</em> way to write a heuristic value function. A <em>heuristic</em> in programming is a procedure that may not derived from a general principle, and whose success is not guaranteed or even necessarily understood. Part of designing a good computer player is designing a good heuristic value function. It has to be simple so that it's easy to compute, but not so simple that it's not helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Implement a simple heuristic value function, together with a depth limited version of the minimax algorithm (see [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Pseudocode">this</a>] for details). Figure out (by trial and error) what depth is reasonable to use for a <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> game and try to see how good you can make the computer player using minimax with that depth and your heuristic value function. Some potential ideas for the heuristic value function:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give higher values to games with mores rows/columns/diagonals that are still potentially winnable.</li>
<li>Give higher values to games with more pieces occupying the center positions.</li>
<li>Give higher values to games that block the other player from winning (when the other player has three in a row/column/diagonal)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="version-2-ios-tic-tac-toe">Version 2: iOS Tic Tac Toe</h2>
<p>For this version, instead of building a computer player, you will be implementing the iOS user interface for <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> tic tac toe with 2 players. The UI should look something like this, though you should customize it as you want.</p>
<p><img src="../Other/TicTacToe-Images/basic-ttt-app.png" style="zoom:25%;" /></p>
<p>Regardless of layout, your UI must have the following elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Game board, as a grid of positions which may be labeled with X or O, centered vertically (at least approximately using <code>Spacer()</code> views).</li>
<li>Status text, which says the current player or says if there is a winner/draw</li>
<li>Reset text, which may be tapped to restart the game, appearing at the very bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a winner, then it should not be possible to add symbols to the board.</p>
<h3 id="your-task-1">Your task</h3>
<p>Build an iOS application for playing tic tac toe using <code>TicTacToeGame</code> as the model and using MVVM architecture for connecting it with the view <code>TicTacToeView</code>&#xA0;(the view is called&#xA0;<code>ContentView</code> by default, but you should rename it to <code>TicTacToeView</code> using Xcode's renaming tool).</p>
<h3 id="extra-credit-opportunity-layout">Extra Credit Opportunity: Layout</h3>
<p>Use the ideas from the video on layouts to more carefully set up the views on the screen. In particular, include the classic tic tac toe cross-hatch grid and center it vertically on the screen. For a further challenge, use rectangle and circle views to represent the symbols X and O, rather than using text.</p>
