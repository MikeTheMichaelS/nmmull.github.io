<h1>Assignment 10</h1>
<p>This assignment is due <strong>Wednesday, July 22 by 6:00PM</strong>. Submit you entire xcode project as a <code>.zip</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="problem-1-lap-counters">Problem 1: Lap Counters</h2>
<p>Implement the Lap Counters application from the video yourself.</p>
<h2 id="problem-2-cleaning-up-the-counter-card">Problem 2: Cleaning up the Counter Card</h2>
<p>One of the issues with the way that individual counters are displayed is that the <em>delete</em> button lowers the position of the number, <em>lap</em> button, and <em>reset</em> button below the center of the card. Reorganize the spacers and rectangles in the <code>CounterView</code> to fix this. As a hint, consider organizing them in the following way, where three rectangles in an <code>HStack</code> are stacked on top of the main rectangle that is colored gray.</p>
