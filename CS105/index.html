            Fundamentals of Computer Programming in Swift (CMSC 10500) is an introductory programming at the University of Chicago.
            Its emphasis is on fundamental concepts like logic, abstraction, data structures and program design.
            Depending on factors such as the availability of certain technologies, we will also discuss Apple application development.
            I have taught this course two times before, but this is the first time it has ever been offered online.
            The material is subject to (many) typographical errors and the like.
