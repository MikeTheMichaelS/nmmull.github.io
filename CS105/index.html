<p>
Fundamentals of Computer Programming in Swift (CMSC 10500) is an introductory programming course.
Its emphasis is on fundamental concepts like logic, abstraction, data structures and program design.
Depending on the availability of certain technologies, we will also cover basic Apple application development.
</p>

<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
<em>About me.</em>
My name is [<a href="http://nmmull.github.io">Nathan Mull</a>].
I am a graduate student instructor, not a professor, so you can just call me by my first name.
</p>

<p>
<em>Course communication.</em>
All the material for this course will be available on this website.
This quarter (Summer 2020) is the first time this course is being offered online, so the material is subject to (many) typographical errors and the like.
We will use [<a href="">Piazza</a>] for offline questions and discussions, and we will use [<a href="https://courses.uchicago.edu">Canvas</a>] for announcements, submissions, and grades.
For individual issues, you can send me an email.
</p>

<p>
<em>Meeting times.</em>
This course has regular meetings on <b>Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 10AM to 12PM</b> and labs on <b>Thursday from 10AM to 12PM</b>.
We will meet via Zoom (using you University of Chicago account).
The meeting link and password are available on the course Canvas site.
</p>

<p>
<em>Resources.</em>
There are no required textbooks for this course, but we will frequently refer to [<a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html">The Swift Programming Language Guide</a>] and the [<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation">Apple Developer Documentation</a>].
</p>

<p>
<em>Grading.</em>
Three components of this course will contribute to your final grade: assignments (50%), labs (20%), and (mini) projects (30%).
Late submissions will be accepted, but you can recieve at most 40% of the total possible score.
This is done so we can freely discuss solutions after due dates.
Your two lowest assignment grades will be dropped.
Final grades may be curved, subject to the grade distribution at the end of the course, but you will recieve no lower than the grade dicated by these percentages.
</p>

<p>
<em>Course policies.</em>
There are a number of university and course-specific policies related to academic honesty, disability accomodations, discrimination, recording, etc., with which you should be familiar.
I have compiled them [<a href="../policies.html">here</a>].
Please read them carefully.
