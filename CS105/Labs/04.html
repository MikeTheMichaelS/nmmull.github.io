<h1>Lab 4: Ordered Dictionaries</h1>
<p>This lab is an exercise in structure design and data abstraction. You will fill in a partial definition of an ordered dictionary structure, a data type with key-value pairs ordered by when the keys were added. So pairs for newly added keys appear at the end of the order but updating values at a given key does not affect the order.</p>
<p>There are two of data representations in the structure, one is just an array if key-value pairs called <code>data</code>, the other has two parts, a dictionary, and an array of keys, <code>data1</code> and <code>data2</code>. For each of these data representations you will define the getter/setter functions given in the structure.</p>
<p>Everything else you have to fill in is on the other side of the abstraction barrier and should not depend on the data representation, only on the getter/setter functions. You should be able to switch out the representation and the getter/setter functions without changing anything else and still pass all the tests. These methods either already appear in the <code>Dictionary</code> type or (I believe) are specified clearly enough by their name. If this is not the case, please let me know.</p>
<p><em>Note.</em> You might have noticed that the variable <code>S</code> for the <code>OrderedDictionary</code> type is annotated by <code>: Hashable</code>. This is an example of a type constraint, the topic for the next meeting. You should be able to ignore it for the sake of this lab. It basically means that we can use <code>S</code> as keys in dictionaries, like <code>data1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="subscripts">Subscripts</h3>
<p>There is one Swift tool we haven't covered that we will be using for this lab. In Swift, the syntax for indexing an array or a dictionary (e.g., <code>l[2]</code> or <code>d["key"]</code>) is not just specialized syntax for these objects. This syntax can be used for any type via subscripts. To do this, we just have to include a <code>subscript</code> method in the type.</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>subscript(i1: Type1, ..., iK: TypeK) -&gt; TypeO {
    get {
        // Code that is run when evaluating an expression like x[v1, ..., vk]
    }
    set(newValue) {
       // Code that is run on an assignment like x[v1,...,vk] = newValue
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Subscripts behave a lot like computed properties. The <code>get</code> methods is called when the subscript is used in an expression and the <code>set</code> function is used when the subscript is used in the subject of an assignment.</p>
<p>We will use subscripts so that we can index our ordered dictionaries like the built-in dictionaries.</p>
<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>This lab is due by <strong>Monday, July 20 by 6PM</strong>. Please submit a file <code>Lab4.swift</code> to Canvas. You should include <strong>both</strong>&#xA0;versions of the getter/setter functions, one for each data representation, but one version should be commented out. The code you submit should run with all the tests uncommented. You should start with the provided [<a href="../Code/Course/Lab4-starter.swift">starter code</a>].</p>
