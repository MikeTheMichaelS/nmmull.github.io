    <p class="subhead">
      Boston University<br>
      Fall 2023
    </p>

    <p>There are a number of university policices and course guidelines
    you should be aware of. <em>Read them carefully and completely.</em>
    Also keep in mind that, though I am required to use specific
    language in some cases, I stand behind these policies sincerely and
    seriously, and I hope you feel comfortable reaching out to me about
    any of them if you need to. See the <a
    href="https://www.bu.edu/policies/">BU Policies</a> page for a
    complete collection of university's policies.</p>
    <h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
    <p>Please read the BU's <a
    href="https://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/">academic
    conduct code</a>. This is taken very seriously at BU and I take it
    seriously in the courses I teach.</p>
    <p>I encourage students to work and study in groups, it's a useful
    way to learn, but when you write down your solutions to an
    assignment, you should do it from your own memory, without looking
    at anyone's work. It is just as important that you <em>never</em>
    let anyone use your work. All parties are culpable in cases of
    academic misconduct.</p>
    <p>If you work with others, consult materials found on the internet,
    or use an AI assistant, you should cite your sources. This is a
    useful skill in any setting, and so I recommend being as
    conservative as possible regarding what you cite. In any assignment,
    these <code>citations
    should appear at the top of the submission</code> (in comments if
    the submission is code). Some examples:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I discussed problem 1 and 2 with Leah Smith. She helped me
    understand X and Y aspects of the problem.</li>
    <li>I saw the stack overflow post
    <em>stackoverflow.com/questions/6681284/python-numpy-arrays</em>
    which informed my solution.</li>
    <li>I helped Zihan Guo with problem 4. I told them to try using
    X.</li>
    <li>I asked chatGPT "what's the largest eigenvalue of this matrix?"
    but asked it not to show me how to solve for it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, it can be tricky determining when a citation is
    necessary. Again, when in doubt, err on the side of longer, more
    descriptive citations. And again, <code>all parties are
    culpable</code>. Those who share their work with others (this
    includes sending files and screen sharing) receive the same
    attention as those who use that work. Please email me immediately if
    you are unsure about a particular situation.</p>
    <p>The line between collaboration, abuse of online resources, and
    misconduct has become incredibly blurry, and cases are becoming more
    difficult to navigate. There are obvious prohibitions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Don't share your solutions with anyone else</li>
    <li>Don't use the solutions of other students</li>
    <li>Don't ask homework questions online on sites like Stack
    Overflow</li>
    <li>Don't ask an AI assistant for a solution to a homework
    question</li>
    <li>Don't consult a solution posted online, even if only to verify
    your own</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It would be naive of me to believe that these things never
    happen, or that I can recognize every case that it happens. But I
    have to depend on the integrity of all of you, which also means that
    I have to take seriously cases of academic misconduct if they do
    unfortunately come up. Use your best judgment and remember:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I and the course staff care about your success in this course.
    We provide a number of avenues to ask for help, please use them</li>
    <li>You will have to answer questions on exams, without external
    aids</li>
    <li>If you don't know how to start thinking about a problem,
    <code>it's okay
     to ask for pointers on how to start</code> in office hours and
    Piazza. We can't give you any of the answer, but we may be able to
    put you in the right direction</li>
    <li>We build in safe-guards (like dropped homework assignments) in
    the case you are unable to complete an assignment</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="disability-statement">Disability Statement</h2>
    <p>If you require disability accomodations, please contact me as
    soon as possible. You should provide me with the appropriate
    documentation, available though BU's <a
    href="https://www.bu.edu/disability/">Diability and Access
    Services</a>. If there's a policy you see that I'm failing to comply
    with, please reach out with suggestions. And if you'd like
    accomodations that are not covered by existing services or policies,
    feel free to contact me and we can see what we can do. I want
    everyone to feel able to fully participate in the course.</p>
    <h2 id="diversity-statement">Diversity Statement</h2>
    <p>My aim is to present material in a way that respects the
    diversity of the student body. If I fail to do this, please make me
    aware. Any suggestions are welcomed and appreciated. I also expect
    students taking any course of mine to appreciate and respect the
    unique opportunity they have to participate in a diverse student
    body.</p>
    <h2 id="sexual-misconduct">Sexual Misconduct</h2>
    <p>Please read BU's <a
    href="https://www.bu.edu/policies/sexual-misconduct-title-ix-hr/">Sexual
    Misconduct Policy</a> and review the entire page for information
    about talking to someone confidentially about experiences of sexual
    misconduct, filing a report, and any other relevant information.
    Above all, you should feel safe, and able to be productive. If this
    is not the case, please reach out to me or someone else
    immediately.</p>
    <p>The university is legally obligated to investigate reports of
    sexual misconduct, and therefore it cannot guarantee the
    confidentiality of a report, but it will consider a request for
    confidentiality and respect it to the extent possible. I am also
    required to report incidents of sexual misconduct and
    <code>cannot guarantee confidentiality</code>. I must provide our
    Title IX coordinator with relevant details such as the names of
    those involved in the incident.</p>
    <h2 id="a-comment-on-generative-ai">A Comment on Generative AI</h2>
    <p>We're going to be talking about the role of AI assistants in
    education for the next decade, and the truth is that no one knows at
    this moment what we're going to do about it. You are the first
    generation that this is impacting, and not just in college, but
    likely when you leave as well.</p>
    <p>This can be a good thing. You have the ability to shape your
    relationship with these tools (even if that means you choose not to
    use them, or even to fight against their use). But as this is
    happening, we still need to run courses at universities.</p>
    <p>It would be drastic for me to prohibit the use of AI assistants,
    but they
    <code>should not be used to solve homework assignments directly</code>.
    I've seen some very powerful and creative ways that they have been
    used to aid learning. Some ideas:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ask explicitly for the solution not to be given</li>
    <li>Ask about high-level ideas, like analogies or mnemonics</li>
    <li>Ask for explanations about how code works, or why a piece of
    code is not working</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any other suggestions please let me know. The point
    is, it's possible to use these tools in productive ways. Remember,
    <code>they're
    not perfect</code>, they can be wrong, it can sometimes be easy to
    tell when a solution was produced by an AI assistant, and you won't
    have access to them in exams.</p>
