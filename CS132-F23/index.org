This course is an introduction to linear algebra with a bent towards
applications in computer science. One of its primary goals is to
prepare students for courses in the CS cirriculum at BU which require
some degree of linear algebra. It is based on (and depends heavily on
the material of) the version of the course taught by [[https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/][Mark Crovella]].
