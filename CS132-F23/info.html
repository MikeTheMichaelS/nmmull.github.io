    <p><strong>CAS CS 132 (Geometric Algorithms)</strong> is an
    introduction to <code>linear
    algebra</code> with a bent towards applications in computer science.
    One of its primary goals is to prepare students (you) for courses in
    the CS cirriculum at BU which require some degree of linear algebra.
    Due to the fundamentality of linear algebra, in machine learning, in
    graph algorithms, in optimization, in graphics (and so on), this
    list of courses is substantial.</p>
    <p>I want to also make clear at the offset that this is <em>not</em>
    a course in computational geometry in the traditional sense; we will
    not cover some beautiful topics like triangulation, mesh generation,
    geometric data structures, or convex programming (despite the
    seemingly out-dated description of the course in our registrar).</p>
    <p>Instead, we will be covering other beautiful topics like matrix
    factorization, eigenvectors, Markov chains (and so on again). The
    "geometric" part comes from the way we will learn to <em>think</em>
    geometrically, in how linear algebra will help us conceptualize data
    as something spatial. Professor Mark Crovella has a nice note on
    this in the <a
    href="http://mcrovella.github.io/CS132-Geometric-Algorithms/landing-page.html">preface
    of the text</a> we will be using for this course.</p>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Prerequisites</strong></em> ⟫ CAS CS 111 (in
    particular, knowledge of python)</p>
    <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Material</strong></em> ⟫ We will primarily be using
    the <a
    href="http://mcrovella.github.io/CS132-Geometric-Algorithms/landing-page.html">online
    text</a> written by Professor Mark Crovella for this coures. The
    text is a jupyter notebook which you can <a
    href="https://github.com/mcrovella/CS132-Geometric-Algorithms">access
    online</a>. All supplementary material will be made available on
    this site and on Piazza.</p>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Programming</strong></em> ⟫ The programming
    assignments for this course (and the examples in the text) are
    written in <code>python</code> with the libraries, numpy, scipy, and
    matplotlib. It is required that you set this up on you personal
    machine or on a machine that you will have access to over the
    semester. Please attend office hours and use Piazza if you need help
    troubleshooting. If you are worried about access to technology,
    please contact me <em>as soon as possible</em> and we can see what
    we can do (though I cannot make any guarantees).</p>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Course Communication</strong></em> ⟫ Course
    announcements and discussions will happen on <code>Piazza</code>. If
    you are unfamiliar with Piazza, see their <a
    href="https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/48000185443">support
    page</a> for information and tutorials. Some policies regarding the
    use of Piazza:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>Don't ask homework questions directly.</code> Formulate a
    question which will aid in your understanding, and will hopefully
    help others as well.</li>
    <li><code>Don't give homework solutions directly.</code> The
    answer-provider is just as culpable as the answer-receiver in cases
    of cheating.</li>
    <li>Piazza is as useful as it is active. Teaching fellows and course
    assistants will be answering questions on Piazza, but don't hesitate
    to answer questions yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Homework Submission</strong></em> ⟫ Assignments are
    submitted on <code>Gradescope</code>. If you are unfamiliar with
    Gradescope, see their <a
    href="https://www.gradescope.com/get_started">get-started page</a>
    for information and tutorials.</p>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Office Hours</strong></em> ⟫ Please see Piazza for
    posted offices hours.</p>
    <h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Homework</strong></em> ⟫ Problem sets are
    <code>assigned each Thursday</code> and are <code>due the
    following Thursday</code> by <code>2PM</code>. You can discuss
    assignments during sections on Mondays, but TFs not go into details
    of the problems.</p>
    <p>Each assignment will consist of two parts, one part
    <em>analytical</em> (calculations/proofs) and one part
    <em>computational</em> (python code).</p>
    <p>For the analytic portion, you will
    <code>submit a PDF via Gradescope</code>. Your submissions may be
    scans of handwritten notes or PDFs created using Word, markdown,
    LaTeX, etcetera (this is the preferred choice, and I highly
    recommend learning LaTeX, especially if you're interested in doing
    research). Handwritten submissions MUST be neat and the graders have
    license to dock points if your submission is not legible. For the
    computational portion, you will
    <code>submit code via Gradescope</code>.</p>
    <p>There are <code>12 problem sets</code> in total (the last one is
    shorter but worth the same amount) and your
    <code>10 highest scores</code> will contribute to your final
    grade.</p>
    <p><code>Late assignments will not be accepted.</code> This allows
    us to post solutions in a timely manner.</p>
    <p>Expect to commit some time each week to these assignments.</p>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Exams</strong></em> ⟫ There will be
    <code>one midterm</code> and a <code>cumulative final</code>.</p>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Participation</strong></em> ⟫ Part of your grade
    will be determined by your participation in weekly polls on
    Piazza.</p>
    <p>⟪ <em><strong>Grading</strong></em> ⟫ Your final grade will be
    determined by</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>50%</strong> homework (top 10 of 12 scores)</li>
    <li><strong>20%</strong> midterm exam</li>
    <li><strong>30%</strong> final exam</li>
    <li><strong>05%</strong> participation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cut-offs for letter grades will be determined at the end of the
    course. I cannot guarantee what the cut-off will be, but you will
    not receive a letter grade lower than the one determined by your <a
    href="https://www.bu.edu/academics/wheelock/policies/grades-course-credits-incomplete-coursework/">raw
    percentage</a>.</p>
